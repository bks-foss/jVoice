jVoice
======
The aim of this project is:

* Define a powerful and flexible application architecture that will allow us to create complex IVR applications for real business cases.
* Create a set of tools that will assist in the creation of those applications making the process as productive as possible.
* Create a runtime, based on standards, that will support the applications and will make them IVR vendor independent.
   

All the general assets will be contained in this repository: Project documentation, installation instructions, etc.

All the specific assets related with runtime (<https://github.com/bks-foss/jVoice-runtime>) or tooling (<https://github.com/bks-foss/jVoice-tooling>) are hosted in their respective repositories.
