The aim of this project is:

* Define a powerful and flexible application architecture that will allow us to create complex IVR applications for real business cases.
* Create a set of tools that will assist in the creation of those applications making the process as productive as possible.
* Create a runtime, based on standars, that will support the applications and will make them IVR vendor independent.
